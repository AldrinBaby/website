        <p><b>Vimala Public school</b> is  Started in 1997, Vimala Public School has emerged as one of the premier CBSE schools in Thodupuzha.

            Vimala Public School  is a Senior Secondary CBSE School situated 1 km away from Thodupuzha town on the Kanjiramattom Bypass Rd. Started in 1997, it is managed and administered  by  Pavanatma Educational Trust - CMC sisters of Kothamangalam Province. 
            The chief educational aim of Vimala Public School is the formation of the ‘person’, and not mere information. This implies the guided development of the physical, mental, moral, intellectual and spiritual powers of the child. 
            We help our students become integrated and responsible members of the communities in which they live - the family, the school, the neighbourhood, the nation and the modern world.
             We mould children with a clean sense of discipline, responsibility, initiative, self reliance and integrity.
             We develop positive attitudes of life, which will lead to empathetic understanding of others and their integrity.
             Care for the development of those skills, by which our students can acquire knowledge and understanding namely the skills of listening, reading, writing, speaking, observing and calculating.
             We nurture the values which will determine the patterns of behaviour required to live in harmony with individuals and with nature.
